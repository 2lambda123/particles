Python 2 vs Python 3 
====================

**particles** is currently compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. When 
Python 2 gets deprecated (around 2020) Python 2 support may be dropped. 

Requirements
============

The short version: install anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution), 
to get all the scientific computing libraries you may ever need in one go. 

The long version: **particles** requires the following libraries: 

* NumPy (>=1.9, http://www.numpy.org/)
* SciPy (>=0.14, https://www.scipy.org/) 
* `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_: just-in-time compiler; 
  **particles** runs without it, but not as fast. 

In addition, it is **strongly recommended** to install: 

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_, 
  `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_: plotting libraries.
  Not needed for core functionality, but most of the examples require these
  libraries to plot results. 

Again, the easiest way to install all these libraries in one go is to simply
install the anaconda distribution (or alternatively the EPD, Enthought Python 
distribution, see 
`here <https://www.enthought.com/product/enthought-python-distribution/>`_). 
Manual installation is also possible on Linux machines; e.g. on Ubuntu::

    sudo apt install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-seaborn

Note however that numba is available in Ubuntu 18.04, but not in previous
versions, and installing it manually is a bit of a pain. 

Basic installation
==================

The package is available on `pypi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>` 
(the Python package index), so you may install it by running pip. On a Linux 
machine:: 

    pip install particles

Manual installation
===================

The package is available at <https://github.com/nchopin/particles.git>
and may be installed using git::

    git clone https://github.com/nchopin/particles.git
    pip install -e --user . 
    cd particles
    f2py -c ../src/LowDiscrepancy.f -m lowdiscrepancy
